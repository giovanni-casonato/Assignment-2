Homework-2
1. Design a program, which, applies the Hebbian learning rule to the input/output mappings
presented in slides 16 and 17 of the Lecture-3 class notes. Use the Hebb function designed in
Project 1. Test for each of these two input/output mappings whether the weights obtained by the
Hebbian rule implement it or not. (undergrads - 90/100, graduates – 60/100))
2. (Required for graduates and extra credit for undergrads). Apply the Hebb function to the
following real to binary input/output mappings

Test for each of these two input/output mappings whether the weights obtained by the Hebbian
rule implement it or not. (undergrads – 30 extra credit points, graduates – 30/100))
3. Write a brief report with your conclusions (10/100)
4. Turn in your source code, a screen shot of its test run and your report.
